This project is the simple interface between two microcontrollers and python.
Project technology:
1. Arduino - This is a microcontroller that support different communication protocols(UART,SPI, I2C) to mention few,.
 This project is using serial communication of arduino microcontroller to send the data to python using pyserial, a python library for serial interfacing.
2. RC522- This is a RFID reader module that is used to read rfid cards and send the data of rfid cards to the arduino microcontroller for processsing.
3. Python is used to for interface the arduino with MySQL database for data storage.
4, MySQL Dataabase - This is used the the storage since it has vast amount of space to store data and is easy accessable every where in the world, 
the storage can be very expensive but with this form of storage it is easy and cost effective to build data logging using cloud storage.
5. Xammp server- This project is using xammp server for testing the code and MySQL for storage and is hosted locally.
